    <string name="tell_a_colleague_mail_text_part1">Greetings! \n\n
        I’ve been using the FREE CWT To Go mobile app and thought you may like it. \n\n
        
        My CWT-booked itineraries are sent automatically to the app so I don’t need to forward them to an email address or manually enter them. Plus, the app notiﬁes me of ﬂight delays, gate assignment/changes, and more. \n\n
        
        Check it out!  \n\n\n
